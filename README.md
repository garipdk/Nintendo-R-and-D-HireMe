# Presentation



This project is my attempt at the hiring test process of Nintendo Europe Research and Developpment (NERD).



# Compile & Launch



There is instructions on how to build and launch this project


## Compile


The project is compilable with two differant ways on unix systems :


### CMAKELIST.TXT

```cd build```  
```cmake ../src```  
```make <target_cmake>```

where *target_make* is one of :

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HireMe_release_omp

### MAKEFILE

```make <target_make>```

## LAUNCH EXEC


When launching one of the targets you need to precise as first argument one of the folowing solving function you want to use :  
*   **BASE** : solving for a given input (find the input back from the modified input of Forward).  
*   **ALLIT** : solving for a given target (16 chars) by conputing all input possible at the end of Forward and goig back like with **BASE** Iteratively.  
*   **ALLRAND**: same as **ALL IT** but the the input possible at the end of Forward is chosen randomly.  
*   **GENETIC** : a gentic implemantation with selection/reproduction/mutation/regular random input.  
*   **RAND** : a totaly random implemantation -> each itteration a random input is created and tested with Forward.

Currently the only true solver working is the **ALLIT** (**BASE** works too but it is not a solver).


### BASE

The command must be executed like so :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```./path/to/exec BASE <Print_Mode> <input>```  
Where :  
*   *Print_Mode* Can Be only one of the following :  
*   *   A : All.  
*   *   C : Coherents only (start with only coherents alphanumeric ascii letter and ends with a 0x00 (at or before the 32th char)).  
*   *   N : Non coherents only.  
*   *   O : None and allows the use of a Simplified Forward (for the end verification because the rest is already it) for time calculation purposes.  
*   *input* Is the input wanted to be generated by my Backward function from the input state at the end of the forward function must be at least 31 chars long. (the first 0x00 must be at least at the 32th char (because the 32 chars are a must and I don't think C args can be processed with a 0x00 befor the end of the string)).

### ALLIT SOLVER

The command must be executed like so :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```./path/to/exec ALLIT <Print_Mode> <target> <number_of_input>```  
Where :  
*   *Print_Mode* Can Be only one of the following :  
*   *   A : All.  
*   *   C : Coherents only (start with only coherents alphanumeric ascii letter and ends with a 0x00 (at or before the 32th char)).  
*   *   N : Non coherents only.  
*   *   O : None and allows the use of a Simplified Forward (for the end verification because the rest is already it) for time calculation purposes.  
*   *target* Is the target whanted to be generated by the Forward function must be at least 15 chars long (the first 0x00 must be at least at the 16th char).  
*   *number_of_input* The number of generated input wanted (between 1 and MAX u128).

### ALLRAND SOLVER

The command must be executed like so :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```./path/to/exec ALLRAND <Print_Mode> <target> <number_of_input>```  
Where :  
*   *Print_Mode* Can Be only one of the following :  
*   *   A : All.  
*   *   C : Coherents only start with only coherents alphanumeric ascii letter and ends with a 0x00 (at or before the 32th char)).  
*   *   N : Non coherents only.  
*   *   O : None and allows the use of a Simplified Forward (for the end verification because the rest is already it) for time calculation purposes.  
*   *target* Is the target whanted to be generated by the Forward function must be at least 15 chars long (the first 0x00 must be at least at the 16th char).  
*   *number_of_input* The number of generated input wanted (between 1 and MAX u128).

### GENETIC SOLVER

The command must be executed like so :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```./path/to/exec GENETIC <Print_Mode> <target> <pool_size> <number_of_input> <elimination_size> <reproduce_size>```  
Where :  
*   *Print_Mode* Can Be only one of the following :  
*   *   A : All.  
*   *   C : Coherents only (start with only coherents alphanumeric ascii letter and ends with a 0x00 (at or before the 32th char)).  
*   *   N : Non coherents only.  
*   *   O : None and allows the use of a Simplified Forward (for the end verification because the rest is already it) for time calculation purposes.  
*   *target* Is the target whanted to be generated by the Forward function must be at least 15 chars long (the first 0x00 must be at least at the 16th char).  
*   *pool_size* The size of the genetic solution pool (between 2 and UINT_MAX).  
*   *number_of_input* The number of generated input wanted (between 1 and *pool_size*).  
*   *elimination_size* The number of elements in the pool that will be eliminated (between 1 and *pool_size* - 1).  
*   *reproduce_size* The number of elements in the pool that will reproduce (between 1 and *pool_size*/3).

### RAND SOLVER

The command must be executed like so :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```./path/to/exec RAND <Print_Mode> <target>```  
Where :  
* Print_Mode Can Be only one of the following :  
*   *   A : All.  
*   *   C : Coherents only (start with only coherents alphanumeric ascii letter and ends with a 0x00 (at or before the 32th char)).  
*   *   N : Non coherents only.  
*   *   O : None and allows the use of a Simplified Forward (for the end verification because the rest is already it) for time calculation purposes.  
*   *target* Is the target whanted to be generated by the Forward function must be at least 15 chars long (the first 0x00 must be at least at the 16th char).  
*   *number_of_input* The number of generated input wanted (between 1 and MAX u128).
